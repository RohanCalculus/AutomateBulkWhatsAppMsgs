# 📩 Automating WhatsApp message to send it to different numbers!

### 🎯 **Aim**           
_This project is developed for [Spartificial](https://spartificial.com) to automate the process of sending invitations to students via WhatsApp for their programs and workshops._

### ➡️ **Guidelines**
_Follow the steps below:-_
1. _Create a folder with all the files in this repo and name it as WhatsApp._
2. _Add the csv file that must contain a column for names and phone numbers to send messages to._
3. _Replace the dir_path with actual path of this csv file in whatsapp.py (line 15)._
4. _Use urlencoded_text.py to encode your English text (msg) into the url encoder format (use the comments in the file as a guide to use it)._
5. _Use mouse_coordinates.py to get the mouse coordinates to click the necessary buttons (use the comments in the file as a guide to use it)._
6. _Paste the encoded text (line 47) and the mouse coordinates (line 55 and 59) in whatsapp.py._
7. _Run the whatsapp.py and enjoy the process of automation!_

### 👨‍💻 **Future work(s)**
_This code currently works only for the Indian mobile numbers as this code was developed in that way. However,_
 - _One can create a dictionary with names of countries and respective country code._
 - _Then a column of country can be used in the csv file to call the country code._
